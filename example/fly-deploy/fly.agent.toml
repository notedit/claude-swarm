# Fly.io configuration for the Agent image
#
# This app is used as an image registry for agent machines.
# Machines are NOT deployed by `flyctl deploy` — they are created dynamically
# by the Orchestrator via the Fly Machines API. This config is used only to
# build and push the agent Docker image to the Fly registry.
#
# Usage:
#   cd <project-root>
#   flyctl deploy -c example/fly-deploy/fly.agent.toml --image-only
